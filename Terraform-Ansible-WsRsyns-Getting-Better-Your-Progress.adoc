== Ansible - Terraform - Workspace Rsync: pass:q[<br>]Together for better development experience

[.background]

== Problems

[.background]
image::blackwp.png[]
// TODO what is problems with firmware team development process now
// comments
* Dependence on Servers
* Server is a limited resource and must be shared between the whole firmware team.
* Our server is quite outdated and gives bad performance.
// People while working on the server will restrict permission. Then
// they can not freely to customize their development environment.
* Cannot freely customize development environment in the server.
* Not good on developing experience.
That affects the performance of FW team.

== What we need now ?

[.background]
image::blackwp.png[]

* Upgrading the servers or just buying new one.
* Decentralize the server workload (Using Docker as a builder or use Cloud Server)
* Smarter process (method) while developing in the remote environment.

== Build your own Server and pass:q[<br>]be free from any restrictions

// TODO

== Challenges

[.background]
image::blackwp.png[]
// must learn about how to configure a server in Cloud
* Boring configure workload.
Must learn about cloud service provider.
* Pay fees for cloud service provider (Expensive)
* Still struggle with development experience.

== Terraform + Ansible + Workspace Rsync:pass:q[<br>]A formation to solve all challenges above.

[.background]
image::blackwp.png[]

* Terraform: Focusing on talk with cloud service providers.
In the case is GCP.
* Ansible: Focusing on talk with each OS which deploy in cloud instance.
* Workspace-Rsync: Focusing on making our development experience easier.

== Why I choose GCP instead of AWS/Azure ?

[.background]

* Free tier with 300$ with simple register process
* Easy to get credentials file
* Simple price model in preemptible instance.

== Terraform, make a simple Hello world ?
